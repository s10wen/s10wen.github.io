      <p>Here’s the second part of my <a href="/blog/2014/03/17/chillout-weekend-part-1-of-2/">Chillout Weekend</a> post, where I took a weekend out to unplug.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<h2 id="Part-1-Halo-1"><a href="#Part-1-Halo-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 - Halo 1"></a>Part 1 - Halo 1</h2><p><img src="/blog/2014-03-26/halo1.jpg" alt="Halo 1"></p>
<p>I love Halo. Fullstop.</p>
<p>I’ve completed every Halo game in the series on Legendary and loved every minute of it.</p>
<p>I’m eagerly awaiting the next installment, but whilst I wait I’ve decided to go through all the previous Halo games in the series.</p>
<p>Here’s a few notes and photo slideshow highlighting some of my most memorable moments.</p>
<h3 id="1-The-Pillar-of-Autumn-“Escape-intact-as-Covenant-forces-board-your-ship-”"><a href="#1-The-Pillar-of-Autumn-“Escape-intact-as-Covenant-forces-board-your-ship-”" class="headerlink" title="1) The Pillar of Autumn - “Escape intact as Covenant forces board your ship.”"></a>1) The Pillar of Autumn - “Escape intact as Covenant forces board your ship.”</h3><p>Keep Cortana safe, escape The Pillar of Autumn whilst Covenant take over.</p>
<p>Thoughts:<br>First introduction to the massive ship The Pillar of Autumn, Cortana / Captain Keyes, being revived, Master Chief, power suit - shield and 8x bars, elite Covenant attacks in The Pillar of Autumn, get Cortana off the ship, keep her safe, if the enemy gets her they get everything, melee, pistol.</p>
<h3 id="2-Halo-“Seek-out-surviving-Marines-and-help-them-fight-the-Covenant-”"><a href="#2-Halo-“Seek-out-surviving-Marines-and-help-them-fight-the-Covenant-”" class="headerlink" title="2) Halo - “Seek out surviving Marines and help them fight the Covenant.”"></a>2) Halo - “Seek out surviving Marines and help them fight the Covenant.”</h3><p>Rescue survivors on ‘ring’ planet.</p>
<p>Thoughts:<br>Grass, waterfall, stars, needler, warthog, transparent bridge, open world, rescuing people, sniper, sniper zoom, I’m lost, ooops I fell, lots of blue blood.</p>
<h3 id="3-The-Truth-and-Reconciliation-“Board-a-Covenant-ship-in-an-attempt-to-rescue-Captain-Keyes-”"><a href="#3-The-Truth-and-Reconciliation-“Board-a-Covenant-ship-in-an-attempt-to-rescue-Captain-Keyes-”" class="headerlink" title="3) The Truth and Reconciliation - “Board a Covenant ship in an attempt to rescue Captain Keyes.”"></a>3) The Truth and Reconciliation - “Board a Covenant ship in an attempt to rescue Captain Keyes.”</h3><p>The enemy has captured Captain Keyes, on the Covenant ship “The Truth and Reconciliation”, go get him. Get a grav lift up to the ship.</p>
<p>Thoughts:<br>Turret flip, can get in turret, invisibility cloak, funny talk - ‘yikes’, ‘I had that one’, ‘One alien down’, hunters, orange blood, gravlift up ship, invisible Covenant with sword, can’t pick up sword, more hunters, pretty purple corridors in ship, prison bay area with invisible Covenant and sword, Captain Keyes found, talking about ‘ring world (Halo)’, Covenant looking for Halo’s control room, new mission - get to the control room, escape ship, invisible Covenant with swords again, escape in Covenant ship.</p>
<h3 id="4-The-Silent-Cartographer-“Search-for-the-map-room-that-will-lead-you-to-the-secrets-of-Halo-”"><a href="#4-The-Silent-Cartographer-“Search-for-the-map-room-that-will-lead-you-to-the-secrets-of-Halo-”" class="headerlink" title="4) The Silent Cartographer - “Search for the map room that will lead you to the secrets of Halo.”"></a>4) The Silent Cartographer - “Search for the map room that will lead you to the secrets of Halo.”</h3><p>A desert island, surrounded by an awesome looking sea. Here there’s a map room that shows the control room location. Get to this room.</p>
<p>Thoughts:<br>Sky, island, warthog, get locked out, find override, hunters, more hunters, map room, invisible Covenant, rocket launcher, more hunters, door open, long way down, more hunters, activate the silent cartographer, going up, yellow Covenant with sword at top, invisible Covenant and ship pick up pelican.</p>
<h3 id="5-Assault-on-the-Control-Room-“Defend-the-Control-Room-against-wave-after-wave-of-Covenant-troops-”"><a href="#5-Assault-on-the-Control-Room-“Defend-the-Control-Room-against-wave-after-wave-of-Covenant-troops-”" class="headerlink" title="5) Assault on the Control Room - “Defend the Control Room against wave after wave of Covenant troops.”"></a>5) Assault on the Control Room - “Defend the Control Room against wave after wave of Covenant troops.”</h3><p>Corridors, snow, getting to the control room.</p>
<p>Thoughts:<br>Aerial insertion from underground, snow, gold Covenant with sword, lift, Covenant ships ghost, wraith, big one with big gun, zoom sniper, ice, scorpion tank, scorpion tank you can get in and control woohoo, bye hunters, sleeping grunts, long empty corridor?, nope… invisible Covenant, Halo control center, the ‘forerunner’ built it.</p>
<h3 id="6-343-Guilty-Spark-“Creep-through-a-swamp-to-meet-the-only-enemy-the-Covenant-fear-”"><a href="#6-343-Guilty-Spark-“Creep-through-a-swamp-to-meet-the-only-enemy-the-Covenant-fear-”" class="headerlink" title="6) 343 Guilty Spark - “Creep through a swamp to meet the only enemy the Covenant fear.”"></a>6) 343 Guilty Spark - “Creep through a swamp to meet the only enemy the Covenant fear.”</h3><p>Marsh lands, find Captain Keyes, go inside, flood discovered for the first time, get picked up, the monitor killing flood, separated from Cortana.</p>
<p>Thoughts:<br>Covenant running around, dead Covenant, huge lift, going down, more dead Covenant, human psycho, oh oh flood, shot gun, electricity thing, big lift down, I’m lost, double jump bit, activate bridge, going up on big lift, teleported inside by monitor to help contain the flood.</p>
<h3 id="7-The-Library-“Fight-your-way-through-an-ancient-security-facility-in-search-of-the-Index-”"><a href="#7-The-Library-“Fight-your-way-through-an-ancient-security-facility-in-search-of-the-Index-”" class="headerlink" title="7) The Library - “Fight your way through an ancient security facility in search of the Index.”"></a>7) The Library - “Fight your way through an ancient security facility in search of the Index.”</h3><p>Following the monitor around to get the index, lots of flood. I remember some hard battles here on legendary.</p>
<p>Thoughts:<br>Exploding flood, following monitor to get the index, door is locked, first of ten, noooo, lots and lots of flood, big long tall corridors, huge massive lift, flood with a rocket launcher, going up again, level title - ‘but I didn’t want to ride the elevator’, drips (green), back on huge massive lift, title - ‘4, super weapons’, got the index, but monitor takes it, turns out adding the index to activate Halo will destroy all life, thus starving the flood, also monitor mentions other Halo rings.</p>
<h3 id="8-Two-Betrayals-“Re-activate-the-weapon-at-the-heart-of-Halo…-and-learn-the-truth-”"><a href="#8-Two-Betrayals-“Re-activate-the-weapon-at-the-heart-of-Halo…-and-learn-the-truth-”" class="headerlink" title="8) Two Betrayals - “Re-activate the weapon at the heart of Halo… and learn the truth.”"></a>8) Two Betrayals - “Re-activate the weapon at the heart of Halo… and learn the truth.”</h3><p>Escape and destroy the Halo ring so monitor can’t activate it. Snow, corridors bit going back through level destroying cores.</p>
<p>Thoughts:<br>Back to snow bit, destroy cores, now fighting sentinels, Covenant and flood, going back through level (where I fell off with Scorpion), no banshee through the door, lots of fighting going on in the distance, yes - you can get up there (banshee), final core destroyed, Cortana teleports us.</p>
<h3 id="9-Keyes-“Stage-a-one-cyborg-assault-on-a-Covenant-ship-and-bring-back-the-Captain-”"><a href="#9-Keyes-“Stage-a-one-cyborg-assault-on-a-Covenant-ship-and-bring-back-the-Captain-”" class="headerlink" title="9) Keyes - “Stage a one-cyborg assault on a Covenant ship and bring back the Captain.”"></a>9) Keyes - “Stage a one-cyborg assault on a Covenant ship and bring back the Captain.”</h3><p>Cortana teleports us to Covenant ship, fall into lake, get back to Covenant ship, Keyes becomes part of the flood, Master Chief has to put him down, escape from Covenant ship.</p>
<p>Thoughts:<br>Back in Covenant ship, going to get Captain Keyes, turn corner, fall down into green swamp, grav lift back in, green waterfalls, Covenant ship full of flood, jump down hole, Captain Keyes sounds like he’s in pain, he’s in some flood thing, Master Chief smashes his face in, grunt has big green gun but blows up where killed, escape on banshee.</p>
<h3 id="10-The-Maw-“Destroy-Halo-before-Halo-destroys-all-life-in-the-galaxy-”"><a href="#10-The-Maw-“Destroy-Halo-before-Halo-destroys-all-life-in-the-galaxy-”" class="headerlink" title="10) The Maw - “Destroy Halo before Halo destroys all life in the galaxy.”"></a>10) The Maw - “Destroy Halo before Halo destroys all life in the galaxy.”</h3><p>Back to The Pillar of Autumn, get to the control room, fighting sentinels, flood and Covenant, monitor back.</p>
<p>Thoughts:<br>Destroy Halo, monitor turns up, halts count down, so need to blow manually with grenade, armor room, invisible flood, detonate fusion drive to destroy Halo, engines going critical required extraction, go up lift, everything blowing up, hey up, a warthog, ‘we can’t make it on foot, we need a vehicle’ Cortana, 6 min time limit, to get picked up, oh oh, no pick up, go go go.</p>
<h3 id="Other-Notes"><a href="#Other-Notes" class="headerlink" title="Other Notes"></a>Other Notes</h3><p>No duel wielding, no boost on ghost, no immobilise vehicles with plasma gun, no banshee boost or roll, left stick hold in to crouch (no toggle?), flash light limited.</p>
